# cosmicding

cosmicding is a [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) companion app for COSMIC™ Desktop Environment.  
It provides an alternative frontend to linkding based on [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic).

While cosmicding was designed for COSMIC™ Desktop Environment, it may "run" cross-platform ([#24](https://github.com/vkhitrin/cosmicding/issues/24)).

Features:

- Support multiple linkding instances (or multiple users on the same instance).
- Aggregate bookmarks locally.
- Add/Edit/Remove bookmarks.
- Search bookmarks based on title, URL, tags, description, and notes.

cosmicding has been tested with linkding releases >= `1.31.0`.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Currently cosmicding is hard-codded to build Apple Silicon releases for macOS.

cosmicding is not distributed at the moment, and has to be built manually.
